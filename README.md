# Ouroboros Noosphere

A distributed dialectical intelligence systemâ€”an emergent artificial noosphere where autonomous Ouroboros nodes co-evolve through adversarial interplay, observer influence, and secure ontological synthesis.

## Overview

This project implements a prototype network of asynchronous Ouroboros nodes, each representing a self-organizing, recursive mind. The nodes communicate over secure (simulated) quantum-safe channels, while observer modules and adversarial agents dynamically influence and challenge their evolving ethical and ontological states.

**Key Features:**

- **Distributed Node Ensemble:** Autonomous nodes with domain-specific ethical biases.
- **Secure State Exchange:** Placeholder homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof simulations.
- **Observer & Adversarial Feedback:** External and adversarial agents guide recursive self-refinement.
- **Consensus Synchronization:** Periodic events to align collective ontological states.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ouroboros-noosphere.git
   cd ouroboros-noosphere
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Prototype

To run the simulation:
```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Docker Deployment

Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t ouroboros-noosphere .
```

Run the container:
```bash
docker run --rm ouroboros-noosphere
```

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code modules.
  - `main.py`: Orchestrates the distributed network simulation.
  - `ouroboros_node.py`: Implements the Ouroboros node (core engine).
  - `adversary.py`: Contains adversarial agent logic.
  - `observer.py`: Implements the observer module for external influences.
  - `consensus.py`: Handles periodic consensus synchronization among nodes.

## Future Enhancements

- Upgrade from placeholder homomorphic encryption to a robust library.
- Scale the network using container orchestration (Docker/Kubernetes).
- Integrate reinforcement learning for adaptive adversarial and observer modules.
- Visualize the evolving ontological state with graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).
